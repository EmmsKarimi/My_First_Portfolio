  <h1>Welcome to My Cool Webpage</h1>
  <p>This is my first web page and I'm excited to share it with you!</p>

  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>I am currently learning HTML as part of the ALX Software Engineering program.</p>

  <h3>My Journey</h3>
  <p>It's been fun exploring the basics of how web pages work. HTML is like the skeleton of a website!</p>

  <p>Stay tuned for more cool projects as I grow my skills.</p>
